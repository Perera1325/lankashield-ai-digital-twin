\# Problem Statement



\## Background



Sri Lanka is undergoing rapid digital transformation in energy systems, telecommunications, banking, and enterprise IT infrastructure. However, monitoring systems remain fragmented and reactive.



\## Core Issues



1\. Lack of unified infrastructure monitoring

2\. No digital twin simulation for national infrastructure

3\. Limited AI-based predictive anomaly detection

4\. Growing EV adoption without load optimization strategy

5\. Increasing cyber threats targeting APIs and digital services



\## Risk Analysis



Without predictive intelligence:



\- Power grid overload may increase

\- EV charging instability may occur

\- Telecom outages may increase

\- Cyber attacks may cause infrastructure disruption



\## Research Gap



There is currently no AI-driven digital twin architecture tailored for Sri Lanka’s critical infrastructure ecosystem.



\## Objective



To design and implement a unified AI-powered digital twin platform capable of simulation, anomaly detection, cyber intelligence, and energy optimization.
