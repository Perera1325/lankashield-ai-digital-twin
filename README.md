\## Overview



LankaShield is an AI-driven Digital Twin platform designed to simulate, monitor, predict, and protect Sri Lanka’s critical infrastructure systems.



The system integrates:



\- Power Grid Nodes

\- EV Charging Stations

\- Telecom Infrastructure

\- API Traffic Systems

\- Cyber Monitoring



This project combines Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Energy Engineering, and API Architecture into a unified resilience platform.



---



\## Problem



Sri Lanka’s infrastructure systems operate in isolation with limited predictive intelligence.



There is no unified platform that:



\- Simulates infrastructure digitally

\- Detects anomalies using AI

\- Integrates cyber threat intelligence

\- Optimizes EV and grid load

\- Secures APIs at scale



---



\## Proposed Solution



LankaShield introduces:



\- Real-time digital twin simulation

\- AI-based anomaly detection

\- Cyber threat monitoring module

\- Smart energy optimization engine

\- Secure API gateway integration



---



\## Architecture



The system follows a microservices architecture:



1\. Simulation Service

2\. AI Intelligence Engine

3\. API Gateway Layer

4\. Monitoring Dashboard

5\. DevOps Infrastructure
